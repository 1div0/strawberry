Strawberry Music Player
=======================
README

Strawberry is a audio player and music collection organizer. It was forked from Clementine in 2013 with a diffrent goal.
It's written in C++ and Qt 5 and runs on Linux. The name is inspired by the band Strawbs.

Features:

  * Play and organize music
  * Edit tags on music files
  * Album cover art from Lastfm, Musicbrainz, Discogs and Amazon
  * Native desktop notifications
  * Playlists in multiple formats
  * Transfer music to iPod, iPhone, MTP or mass-storage USB player
  * Support for multiple backends

You can obtain and view the sourcecode on github at: https://github.com/jonaski/strawberry

It has so far been tested on Linux and cross compiled for Windows. I have not had a chance to test it on Mac OS X since I don't have a mac.
