Strawberry Music Player
=======================
README

Strawberry is a modern audio player and music collection organiser. It was forked from Clementine in 2013, and has a diffrent goal.
It's written in C++ and Qt5 and runs on Linux. The name is inspired by the band Strawbs.
The main goal was to create a player for playing local music files that looked a bit more like Amarok 1.4 amd with advanced soundcard options.
You will find that Strawberry is lacking internet services and some other features found in Clementine.

Some differences between Strawberry and Clementine are:

- Status widget similar to context in Amarok 1.4
- Settings have been reorganized
- Advanced backend settings with support for several backends and advanced options
- No Smart playlists, visualizations or cd ripping support
- No LastFM, podcast or internet features except for fetching album covers

There are no plans to add internet streaming features, but if we would add something it has to be a service providing high quality audio and not low audio quality like Spotify.
